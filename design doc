This interface will refer back to the NPC shop and contain a type enum.
Three type enums: MAIN, BUY, SELL

- The Buy Inventory Holder
- The Sell Inventory Holder

The Main Inventory Holder will be the same for all npc shops exempting the title of the inventory.
It will contain a buy item and sell item that will be defined in the config.
